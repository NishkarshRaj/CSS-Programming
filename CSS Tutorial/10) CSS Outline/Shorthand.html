<h1> CSS Outline Shorthand </h1>
<pre>
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out"

CSS has the following outline properties:

    outline-style
    outline-color
    outline-width
    outline-offset
    outline

The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

    outline-width
    outline-style (required)
    outline-color

The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.
