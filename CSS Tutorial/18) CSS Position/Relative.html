<h1> CSS Relative Positioning </h1>
<pre>
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 
Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
