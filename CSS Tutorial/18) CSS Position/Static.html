<h1> CSS Static Positioning </h1>
<pre>
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
</pre>
<div>
<p> Hello? </p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
