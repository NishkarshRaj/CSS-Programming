The position Property

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute
    sticky

Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 
However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
They also work differently depending on the position value.
