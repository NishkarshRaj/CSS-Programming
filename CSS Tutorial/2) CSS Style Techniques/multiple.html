<h1> Multiple Style Sheet Resolution </h1>

If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

<mark> Cascading Order: </mark>

What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

    Inline style (inside an HTML element)
    External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
    Browser default

So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

Breaking Concepts Deep!!! Only the conflicts are resolved else multiple style sheets can be used.
Example! If paragraphs are conflicted then last style is chosen but all other unconflicted styles are chosen from all sources.
