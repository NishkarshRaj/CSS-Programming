An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.
Because, CSS was made to remove styling from core Web Development by HTML language. Using this is not advised.
