The list-style property is a shorthand property. It is used to set all the list properties in one declaration

When using the shorthand property, the order of the property values are:

    list-style-type (if a list-style-image is specified, the value of this property will be displayed if the image for some reason cannot be displayed)
    list-style-position (specifies whether the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow)
    list-style-image (specifies an image as the list item marker)

If one of the property values above are missing, the default value for the missing property will be inserted, if any.
