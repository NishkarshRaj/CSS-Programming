<h1> Font Family to set font of the document </h1>
<pre>
In CSS, there are two types of font family names:

    generic family - a group of font families with a similar look (like "Serif" or "Monospace")
    font family - a specific font family (like "Times New Roman" or "Arial")

Note: On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read than serif fonts.

The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.

The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.

Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list:
