<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>This page has an image as the background!</p>
<pre> 
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.
If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;), the background will look better. 
To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;
</pre>
